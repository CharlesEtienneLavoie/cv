# Academic CVs for Faculty Job Searches (U.S. Context)

[Source: CV Faculty Job Search Presentation (Students).pptx] 

## Key Takeaways

* In the U.S., a CV is a **multi-page** summary of academic and professional accomplishments used specifically for **academic applications** (postdocs, faculty, research positions, grants, fellowships).
* The CV’s function is **not** to secure the job directly but to **generate enough interest to earn an interview**.
* Certain sections are **always required** on an academic CV:

  * Contact information
  * Education
  * Academic experience (teaching, research, academic appointments)
  * Publications and presentations
* Other sections are **optional and selected/tailored** based on the position: professional experience, digital projects, grants, awards, certifications, media coverage, service, memberships, research interests, skills, references.
* **Order and emphasis of sections** should reflect the **priorities of the specific institution, department, and position**.
* Experience sections should present **role, institution, location, dates, and concrete accomplishments**, using **specific details and numbers** where possible.
* Education entries should include **institution, location, degree, date of completion, dissertation title, and advisor**.
* Publication and presentation entries follow **consistent citation-like formatting**, with information on **title, venue, and (for presentations) location and date**.
* On **U.S. CVs**, applicants should **not** disclose: photo, age/birthday, marital status/sex/number of children, Social Security Number, and salary/hours (unless required).
* Job descriptions are a central tool: they should guide which **skills, experiences, and accomplishments** are highlighted and how the CV is **organized**.
* Exercises in the material emphasize **critically reading job postings** and **diagnosing problems in sample CVs** to better understand good practice.

## Integrated Overview

The material presents a practical, workshop-style guide to **constructing an academic CV** targeted at **faculty and related academic roles in the U.S.** The focus is twofold:

1. **Understanding what hiring institutions look for** when evaluating CVs.
2. **Structuring and writing the CV** so that an applicant’s strongest qualifications are prominent and clearly aligned with a given role.

The CV is positioned as a **core document** in academic job searches, especially for **postdoctoral positions, faculty appointments, research roles, and funding opportunities**. It is a multi-page inventory of accomplishments rather than a short résumé. Its primary function is to **spark interest** and move a candidate from application review to **interview**.

The presentation provides:

* A list of **standard CV sections** and an indication of which ones are **always required**.
* **Formatted examples** of crucial sections (Education, Teaching Experience, Research Experience, Publications, Presentations).
* Guidance on **tailoring and organizing** the CV in line with **institutional and departmental priorities**.
* Clear **“do not include” rules** for U.S.-style academic CVs.
* Short **activities** built around a real job description and an example CV, to train candidates in identifying relevant information and structural errors.

Overall, the emphasis is on **clarity, alignment with the job description, and strategic ordering of sections** rather than on ornate design or excessive brevity.

## Detailed Centralization

### 1. Purpose and Role of the CV

* In the U.S., a **Curriculum Vitae (CV)** is a **multi-page summary** of academic and professional accomplishments used **specifically for academic applications**.
* Typical uses:

  * **Postdoctoral positions**
  * **Faculty jobs**
  * **Research positions**
  * **Grants and fellowships**
* The CV is meant to **create interest** in the application for a position.
* It **does not directly “get you the job”**; rather, its main function is to **secure an interview** by convincingly showcasing the applicant’s record and potential.

### 5. Tailoring the CV to the Position

The workshop content emphasizes that **tailoring** is central to effective CV writing.

Key guidance:

* First, **understand the goals and priorities** of:

  * The **institution**
  * The **department**
  * The **specific position**
* Then, use this understanding to:

  * **Reflect in the CV** the applicant’s **skills, accomplishments, knowledge, and experiences** that most closely **align** with those goals.
  * **Order the sections** of the CV based on these priorities:

    * For a position that heavily values teaching, **Teaching Experience** might appear earlier and be more detailed.
    * For research-focused roles, **Research Experience** and **Publications** might be given earlier placement and more emphasis.

The structure of the workshop itself reinforces this:

* Participants are asked to **read a faculty job description** and identify aspects of the position that impact how a CV should be crafted.
* They are also asked to **analyze a sample CV** (Leona’s CV) to identify mistakes given a specific job posting (Georgia Gwinnett College), as a way to practice **critical alignment** between job description and CV structure/content.

### 6. Information to Exclude on U.S. CVs

The presentation sets out explicit **“Do not disclose”** items for **U.S. CVs**:

* **Photo**
* **Age/Birthday**
* **Marital Status/Sex/Number of Children**
* **Social Security Number**
* **Salary information or hours worked**, **unless required**

These exclusions reflect standard practice in U.S. academic CVs, where such information is considered **irrelevant or inappropriate** for evaluation.

### 7. Exercises Used in the Workshop

The slides incorporate interactive **activities** meant to reinforce principles of CV design and tailoring.

#### 7.1 Activity 1: Reading the Job Description

Participants are instructed to:

* **Reference a faculty job description** (linked in the workshop chat).
* **Read through the job posting** carefully.
* Determine:

  * “From the posting, what do we know about the position that will be helpful in crafting a CV for the role?”

The activity’s goal is to train participants to:

* Extract **key signals** from job descriptions.
* Connect these signals to **CV structure and emphasis** (e.g., importance of teaching vs. research, desired fields or methods, service expectations).

Participants are expected to **share their feedback**, either in the chat or by speaking, reinforcing collaborative analysis.

#### 7.2 Activity 2: Diagnosing Problems in a Sample CV

Participants are instructed to:

* **Reference both the faculty job description and an Exercise CV**, provided via links in the chat.
* The job posting used in the activity is for **Georgia Gwinnett College**.
* Task:

  * “Based on the Georgia Gwinnett College job posting and what you know about CV writing, consider what errors Leona made in the construction of her CV.”
* Participants are again to be prepared to **share feedback** in the chat or verbally.
* A **“CV Guidelines”** link is provided, described as a source for a **better example** for this role.

The activity’s purpose is to:

* Encourage participants to **critically evaluate a real CV** in light of a real job posting.
* Highlight the importance of:

  * Appropriate **section selection and ordering**.
  * Correct **content emphasis** for the position.
  * Avoidance of **common mistakes** (though specific errors are not detailed in the slides themselves).

A final **“Questions”** slide closes the session, indicating an opportunity for participants to clarify any remaining doubts.

## Edge Cases, Caveats, and Limitations

* The guidelines presented are **explicitly framed for U.S. academic contexts**, especially regarding:

  * What **not** to include (photo, age, marital status, etc.).
* The material does **not** provide:

  * Full details of the referenced **job descriptions** or **Exercise CV** (Leona’s CV).
  * Specific examples of the **errors** made in the sample CV; it instead prompts participants to find them.
* Some best practices (e.g., **ordering sections** according to institutional priorities, **using specific quantitative details** in bullet points) are **illustrated through examples**, but not exhaustively codified into rules.
* The slides focus on **content and structure**, with little to no discussion of:

  * Visual design/formatting (fonts, margins, etc.).
  * Discipline-specific variations beyond the example from politics.
